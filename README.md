This repository contains official implementaion of the paper "AdaFedProx: A Heterogeneity-aware Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Medical Image Classification". Steps to run the algorithms:

run Data_creation.py after changing the data distribution you want for all the three datsets 1) ISIC-2018 2) Pap Smear 3) Messidor dataset as described in the paper.
run all the algorithms including baseline and Proposed.
